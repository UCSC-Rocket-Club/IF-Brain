What I did:
1) I went to https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/ and towards the top, downloaded the latest version.
2) Run the installer and when you see the window with a bunch of options to check, I only checked the mingw32-base.
3) In that window on the top left, click on the installation tab and click 'apply changes'.
4) Go to start and search 'environment' and open 'edit the system environment variables'
5) Click on 'environment variables' towards the bottom.
6) Click on 'path' under system variables, then click 'edit' then click 'new'.
7) Put in the directory where you installed. something like "..\MinGW\bin"
8) In git, write the command $ mingw-get install gcc
Think thats what I did exactly. I'm on windows 10.
